# Alarm Clock Application ‚è∞

This is a Python-based alarm clock application developed as part of my internship at [GO2COD](https://go2cod.com.et/).
The app allows users to set alarms for specific times, with an intuitive interface built 
using `tkinter` and audio notifications powered by `pygame`.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An easy-to-use GUI created with `tkinter`.
- **Alarm Customization**: Set specific hours, minutes, seconds, and period (AM/PM).
- **Activation & Deactivation**: Easily enable or disable the alarm.
- **Audio Alert**: Plays a sound at the set alarm time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **tkinter**: For creating the GUI.
- **pygame**: Used for playing the alarm sound.
- **Pillow**: To manage and resize images for the GUI.
- **Threading**: For handling alarm operations in the background
